# Guide for Installation and Setup

## 1. Download the QISKit Tutorials

**Get the tutorials**<BR>

The easiest way is to [download](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/archive/master.zip) the tutorials. Unzip the archive in the directory of your choice.

The more advanced user may choose to use `git`. If you have `git` installed, run

```
git clone https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial.git
```

If you need to install `git` follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).


## 2. Install QISKit, QISKit ACQUA and QISKit ACQUA Chemistry

The latest release version of QISKit should be the one installed.

The latest release can be installed using

```
pip install qiskit qiskit-acqua qiskit-acqua-chemistry
```

Or, pre-installed qiskit can be updated using

```
pip install -U qiskit qiskit-acqua qiskit-acqua-chemistry
```

**BUT we recommend the following**:


1. **Install [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html)**

2. **Create conda environment for QISKit and install packages** (with the accompanying `QISKitenv.yml` file)

```
cd qiskit-tutorial
conda env create -f QISKitenv.yml
```

If you have already created `QISKitenv`, you can upgrade it by running

```
conda env update -f QISKitenv.yml
```


## 3. Setup the API Token

Create the `Qconfig.py` from the template provided at `Qconfig.py.template`. Follow the three steps below.

1.  Create an [IBM Q Experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net) account
     if you haven't already done so
2.  Get an API token from the IBM Q Experience website under "My
     Account" &gt; "Advanced" &gt; "API Token"
3.  You will insert your API token in a file called Qconfig.py in
     the ```qiskit-tutorial``` directory. The contents of the file should
     look like:

```
APItoken = 'my token from the Quantum Experience'
config = {'url': 'https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/api'}

if 'APItoken' not in locals():
     raise Exception('Please set up your access token. See Qconfig.py.')
```


## 4. Explore the tutorials

**Activate the environment**<BR>
For MacOS and Linux, run:

```
source activate QISKitenv
```

For Windows, run:

```
activate QISKitenv
```
**Note for conda users**<BR>
You need to be sure that you have installed the right Jupyter Kernel, because in the last conda version it's not installed by default.

```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name QISKitenv --display-name "Python (QISKitenv)"
```

**Start Jupyter with the index notebook**<BR>

```
jupyter notebook index.ipynb
```

## 5. Visualizing Circuits
You can visualize your quantum circuits directly from QISKit. To get publication-quality images, QISKit plots circuits using LaTeX, which means you will need to install some pre-requisite software. These include the `pdflatex` compiler for rendering latex documents, and the Poppler library for converting PDF to image. In the future, we will provide ways of plotting circuits without relying on Latex.

On Linux:

- Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download#unx)
- Install Poppler:
	- Run: ```apt-get install -y poppler-utils```

On MacOS:

- Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download).
- Install Poppler:
	- Run:```brew install poppler```

On Windows:

- Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download).
- Install Poppler:
	- Download the [latest binary](http://blog.alivate.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/poppler-0.51_x86.7z).
	- Extract the downloaded `.7z` file into user directory:
`c:\Users\<user_name>\`.
Note: You will need to have the [7zip software](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) for this.
	- Add to PATH:
		- Right click on "This PC" -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables
		- Add `C:\Users\<user_name>\poppler-0.51\bin` to the user's path.
