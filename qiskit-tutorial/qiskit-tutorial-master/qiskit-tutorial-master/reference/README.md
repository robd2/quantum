# QISKit Reference Tutorials

We've collected a core set of tutorial notebooks in this folder. These notebooks demonstrate how to use QISKit and explore quantum information science, acting as a reference guide for QISKit. We will be keeping them up to date with the latest QISKit version, currently 0.5.

They are organized into the following topics:

## 1. [Getting started with QISKit](tools)
Here we introduce you to the basic features of QISKit.

## 2. [Introduction to quantum information science](qis)
Here we show you how to use QISKit to explore some simple concepts of quantum information science.

## 3. [Understanding your quantum computer](qcvv)
Here we describe a few of the techniques used to characterize, verify, and validate quantum systems.

## 4. [Working on approximate quantum computers](acqua)
Here we describe some of the things you can do with the approximate quantum computers we have today.

## 5. [Examples of quantum algorithms](algorithms)
Here we have examples of canonical quantum algorithms.

## 6. [Having fun with quantum computers](games)
Here we have a few examples of quantum games. Enjoy!
