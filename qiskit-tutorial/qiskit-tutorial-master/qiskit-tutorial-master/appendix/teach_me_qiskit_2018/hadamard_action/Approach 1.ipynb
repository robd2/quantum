    "In order to show the equivalence of the above circuits, first we'll take the most tedious route of simply writing out the full state after each set of gates and comparing the final states of each circuit. One should note that this method doesn't use any abstraction or coding, rather we simply act as a quantum computer by hand by applying the defining logic of the gates to the input states as one reads the circuit from left to right. This gets a bit clunky even for a fairly simple circuit such as ii), showing the amount of effort this method would require when considering circuits complex enough to execute quantum algorithms worth executing.
