# Say Hello to QISKit!

This is the folder for 'hello world'-type examples - simple, relatable, whimsical examples to help someone get their foot in the door of quantum programming with QISKit - quote from James Wootton.

Here are some ideas to get you started.

- **Flip a coin with quantum**. Put one single qubit in superposition, then measure its state. Voila, you have your first quantum coin!
- **Random number generator**. You can put multiple qubits in superposition and then measure their state to get a perfect random number!
- **Entangled states**. Entangle two qubits, investigate their properties, and try to wrap your ahead around this new resource that only quantum computing can provide.
