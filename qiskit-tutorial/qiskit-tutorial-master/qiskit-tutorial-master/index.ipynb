    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome QISKitters to the Quantum Information Science Kit ([QISKit](https://www.qiskit.org/) for short)! \n",
    "\n",
    "To get you started, we have put together a set of tutorials that can be downloaded by clicking [here!](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/archive/master.zip).\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "We have organized the tutorials into three sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. [Hello, Quantum World](hello_world/)\n",
    "Since quantum computing is new to most users, we want to find the best *Hello Quantum World* programs and welcome submissions here. \n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. [Reference](reference/)<a id='reference'></a>\n",
    "We've collected a core reference set of notebooks in this section. These notebooks demonstrate how to use QISKit and explore quantum information science, acting as a reference guide for QISKit. We will be keeping them up to date with the latest QISKit version, currently 0.5.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They are organized into the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 [Getting started with QISKit](reference/tools)\n",
